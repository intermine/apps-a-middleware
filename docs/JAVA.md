## Java Systems

On Java systems the following packages can be used as a replacement for their node.js counterparts.

1. [JCoffeeScript](https://github.com/yeungda/jcoffeescript) compiles CoffeeScript 1.1
2. [Mustache.java](https://github.com/spullara/mustache.java/) does [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) templating as an alternative to eco templates.
3. [YUI Compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) that compresses CSS and JavaScript both.
4. A tool for prefixing CSS selectors would need to be written based on sayÂ [CSS Parser](http://cssparser.sourceforge.net/).
